+channel: This procedure is executed when a user joins a channel. It checks if the channel matches the specified channel (e.g., #example) and logs a message in the Eggdrop bot's console indicating that the user joined the channel.

-channel: This procedure is executed when a user leaves a channel. It checks if the channel matches the specified channel (e.g., #example) and logs a message in the Eggdrop bot's console indicating that the user left the channel.

The Telnet commands bind pubm - +channel and bind pubm - -channel bind these procedures to the Eggdrop bot, so they are triggered when a user joins or leaves the specified channel.

Please ensure that you replace "eggdrop.example.com", 1234, and "password" with the appropriate values for your Eggdrop Telnet server, port, and password. Also, replace "#example" with the actual channel you want your bot to join and leave.

Remember to customize the code further to suit your specific Eggdrop configuration and any additional functionality you may require.
